Plan for 1.0 Release:
	Replace Dunae's code with my own:
		Provide the following existing functionality:
			- Premailer class
				- Parse HTML with either Hpricot or Nokogiri
				- Parse CSS
				- Convert CSS to inline style attrs
				- Provide client support info (probably stick with current YAML file with client support data)
